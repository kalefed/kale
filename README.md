# Personal Portfolio [v1]

Welcome to the first version of my portfolio website! This site serves as a showcase of my skills and an extension of my resume. The website is built using Next.js and styled with Tailwind CSS, while the design was meticulously crafted using Figma.

## ðŸ›  How do I run and install the project?
To explore my portfolio locally, follow these simple steps:
1. Install Dependencies: First, install the necessary project dependencies. You can do this by running either of the following commands, depending on your package manager of choice:
   ```sh
   npm install or yarn
   ```
2. Build and Run: Once the dependencies are installed, you can build and run the project with the following command:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
